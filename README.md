# rekcarT - the reverse internet tracker.

Track sites that are tracking you.

## Installation

Firefox recognizes `.xpi` files as extensions, so create one:

```bash
zip rekcart.xpi manifest.json
```

Firefox versions Firefox 44 or later require extensions to be signed to be installed from disk.

## Hot-reload (developer) testing

```bash
web-ext run
```
